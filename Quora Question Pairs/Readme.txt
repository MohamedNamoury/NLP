Quora is a website to share and gain knowledge on multiple aspects. People can ask
questions about anything and wait for a variety of answers and opinions from ordinary to
expert people. Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, and due to that large
number of users ask answers that are already asked and this blocks them from seeing the
quality answers on the old posts and also blocks other users from seeing new questions
every day.
